# Standalone Mini Accumulo Cluster (SMAC)

## Description

This project is an experiment with the Mini Accumulo Cluster (MAC).  The intent is to make a Standalone executable jar that runs the MAC.  The code lives at https://gitlab.com/mjwall/standalone-mac.  Note, I moved the code to gitlab from github to try out the CI.
